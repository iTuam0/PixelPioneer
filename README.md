Hi everyone, my name is Artyom, I'm from Russia. I am an aspiring Python programmer interested in artificial intelligence. This project I wrote using a search engine based on Chat GPT. 

And it was, uh. it was great. I knew almost nothing about the cv2 and mediapiep libraries, but with the help of a helper I was able to create a simple program that connects to a remote phone camera (URL) and displays the video stream on a specific screen. 

Now I am finalizing the application, writing new functions to it or something like that.
